# DEV - OPS Overview

# Waterfall Model - Agile Model
# solution Is devops of these models

Dev ops is not a technology, it is a methodology
Everything is developing continously in dev ops 

# Dev ops stages 
    version Control - Maintain Different versions of code
    Continuous Integration - Compile, Validate, Code Review, Unit Testing, Integration Tesing
    Continuous Delivery - Deploying the build application to test servers, Performing UAT
    Continuous Deployment- Deploying the tested application on the prod server for release


# Source Code Management
    The management of changes to docuents computer programs. large websiutes and other collection of information
      There are two types of source code management
        Centralized Version Control system
        Destributed Version Control system


# GIT
    Git is a distributed Version Control tool that supports distributed non linear workflow by providing data assuring for developing quality software

# Continuous Itegration  
jenkin server Continouos Integration Tool 
(Jenkin originally written in java)

# Continuous Delivery
Deploy the build application on the test server for uat 

# Continuous Deployment 
Deploy the build application on the prod server for release.

# Configuration Management 
    CM is the pactice of handling changes systematically so that a system maintains its integrity over time
    
    CM ensures that the current design and build state of the system is known, good and trusted
    
    it doesn`t rely on the tacit of knowledge of the development team

# Tools for configuation Manafement
  > Puppet
      this follows master slave architechture

# Containerization
  light weight alternative to virtual machines

# Docker

# Continuous Monitoring
      (Nagios is Continuous Monitoring tool)

    Continuous Monitoring is all about the ability of an organization to detect report, repond, contain and mitigate the attacts that occurs in its infrastructue


# Dev Ops Use Case

    Developer Commiting the code to the git repository 
    then jenkins pull that code and it will clone the repository 
    then it willcreate a doker image
    we are going to test that image and them we oush that image to the doker hub like a git repository

# Tools we are going to use is GIT JENKINS DOKER
