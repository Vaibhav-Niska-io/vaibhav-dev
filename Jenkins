# Jenkins 
    It is an open source automation tool written in java with plugins built for continuous integration puropse. plugins allows integration of various Devops Stages.

# Jenkins Core Concepts
    > Jenkins Controller ( formerly Master)
        the jenkins controller servers as thew central system for managing a jenkins instance often referred to as its heart
        The jenkins Controller loads plugins and ensures that jobs run in the corret sequence
    > jenkins Agent(Formerly Slave)
        Jenkins agent is a machine that performs tasks like running scripts executing test or building components etc.

        There are two main types of agents 
            Permanent Agents - These are always ready and connected to jenkins
                                They are like dedicated workers that are always on standby
            Ephemeral Agents - These are Temporary, jenkins starts them only when needed usually in the cloud or using tool like doker. When the job is done they are swhut down.
    
    > Jenkins Node 
        A jenkins node is a term that is used in jenkins 2.0 to mean any system that can run jrnkins jobs.
        This is mainly used in controlleers and Agents somtimes used insted of those Terms.
        A Node is a machine that jenkins uses to run jobs like building and testing projects.
         Jenkins keeps an eye on all the connected nodes to make sure they are working properly if a node isnt performing well or its health dropes below a certain threshold level jenkins will take that node offline to prevent any problems


    > Jenkins Job 
        jenkins jobs are used to perform the work in the jenkins system. A jenkin
        s jobs is an automatedjob that you set uo in jenkins to do things like build test or deploy your code. Instead of doing these steps manually every time jenkins can do them for you wheather there change in you code this helps saves time and reduces mistakes
    
    > Jenkins Plugins
        Jenkins provide 2000 of commnity cotributed plugins which developers can use for building deploying and automating any project by using jenkins plugins you  can use those featres in your jenkins instance which are not given in jenkins by default. You can easily install and updrage these available plugins easily from the jenkins dashboard  
    
    > Jenkins Pipeline
        Devops Professionls mostly work with pipelines ecause pipeliunes can automate the processess like building testing and deploying the application. Doing manually by ui takes lots of time and effort which will affect productivity with the help of ci/cd pipelineds scrpts we can automate the whole process which all incerease productivity and sace lots oftime for the orgnization and can deliver quality applications to the end users

    > Server based Security
        Jenkins secures both the server and user access. The server (VM or physical) is locked down using OS and network settings, allowing only limited access. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is used to restrict Jenkins UI access to trusted users. Popular security plugins are Role-Based Authorization Strategy, Role-Based Authorization Strategy, Matrix-Based Security etc.
