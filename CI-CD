# Continuous Itegration  
jenkin server Continouos Integration Tool 
(Jenkin originally written in java)

# Continuous Delivery
Deploy the build application on the test server for uat 

# Continuous Deployment 
Deploy the build application on the prod server for release.

# Configuration Management 
    CM is the pactice of handling changes systematically so that a system maintains its integrity over time
    
    CM ensures that the current design and build state of the system is known, good and trusted
    
    it doesn`t rely on the tacit of knowledge of the development team

# Tools for configuation Manafement
  > Puppet
      this follows master slave architechture

# Containerization
  light weight alternative to virtual machines

  # Continuous Monitoring
      (Nagios is Continuous Monitoring tool)

    Continuous Monitoring is all about the ability of an organization to detect report, repond, contain and mitigate the attacts that occurs in its infrastructue

# Contiguous Integration Using Jenkins
  Problem Before CI 
      > Developers have to wait till the completesoftware developed fro the result 
      > Software delivery process was very slow

    #  Continuous integration to the rescue 
        > Since after commit to the source code an auto build is triggered abd then it is automatically developed on the   test server 
        > if the test result showa that there is a bug in the code then the developers only jave to check the last commit  made to the source code
        > this is also increase43 the frequency of new softare release
        > the concerned terms are always provided with the relevent feedback

  # before Continuous Integration 
    the entire source code was built and then tested
    DEvelopers have to wait for the test results 
    No Feedback

  # After Continuous Integration
    Every Commit made in the source code is built and tested 
    Developers know the test result of every commit made in the source code on the run
    feedback is present
    
  # what is continuous integration 
    -> CI is a development practice in which the developers are required to commit changes to the source code in a shared repository several times a day or more frequently
    -> Every commit made in the repository is built. this allows the teams to detect the problems early   

  # CI tools 
      -> Jenkins - it is an open source automation tool written in java with plugins built for continuous integration puropse. plugins allows integration of various Devops Stages.

    -> Plugins 
        Maven, JUnit, HTML Publisher, Jenkins Builf Notifications Plugin, Deploy plugin 

    buildboot
    travis CI
    Bamboo
